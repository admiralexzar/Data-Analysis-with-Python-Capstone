# Predicting House Prices: A Real Estate Data Analysis 

In this project, I’m stepping into the role of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The company is looking to branch out into residential real estate, and my job is to help figure out how much a house is worth based on different features. That includes things like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

The dataset I’m working with includes home sales in King County, Washington (which covers Seattle), from May 2014 to May 2015. It’s been slightly modified for this project, but it still gives a good look at real-world data.

I’ll be using Jupyter Notebook to complete the project.
